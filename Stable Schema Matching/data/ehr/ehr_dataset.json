The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit (UNIT_CONCEPT_ID). The Procedure for obtaining the sample is housed in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table, though it is unnecessary to create a PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE record for each measurement if one does not exist in the source data. Measurements differ from Observations in that they require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a quantitative or qualitative result.

Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and within standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories (like \u2018Cardiovascular disease\u2019), detailed clinical elements (\u2018Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall\u2019) or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.).

Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and within standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories (like \u2018Cardiovascular disease\u2019), detailed clinical elements (\u2018Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall\u2019) or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.).

To link another record to an Observation, the primary key goes in OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID (CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID, DRUG_EXPOSURE_ID, etc.) and the Concept representing the field where the OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID was taken from go in the OBS_EVENT_FIELD_CONCEPT_ID. For example, a CONDITION_OCCURRENCE of Asthma might be linked to an Observation of a family history of Asthma. In this case the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID of the Asthma record would go in OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID of the family history record and the CONCEPT_ID\u00a01147127\u00a0would go in OBS_EVENT_FIELD_CONCEPT_ID to denote that the OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID represents a CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID.",
