To link another record to an Observation, the primary key goes in OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID (CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID, DRUG_EXPOSURE_ID, etc.) and the Concept representing the field where the OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID was taken from go in the OBS_EVENT_FIELD_CONCEPT_ID. For example, a CONDITION_OCCURRENCE of Asthma might be linked to an Observation of a family history of Asthma. In this case the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID of the Asthma record would go in OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID of the family history record and the CONCEPT_ID\u00a01147127\u00a0would go in OBS_EVENT_FIELD_CONCEPT_ID to denote that the OBSERVATION_EVENT_ID represents a CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_ID.",
